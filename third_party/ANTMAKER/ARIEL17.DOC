    Disclaimer

        This program is offered as FreeWare.  No claims are made.  The

    Distribution

        Disassembly and/or modification is prohibited.  Source code
        is not available to the public.  ARIEL may be freely copied 
        and distributed provided this document file is included in its
        entire, unmodified state.  NO fees may be charged for ARIEL
        except for duplication and handling fees not to exceed $1.00US.

    Registration

        There is none.  I tried ShareWare with version 1.5.  What I made
        in registration fees PLUS 25 cents would buy me a cup of coffee,
        and it took more than one cup to write this program.
        
        So, if you want to send me something, the old offer still stands.
        That is $5.00 in cash, stamps, bus tokens, rubbles, pesos, or any-
        thing of near-equivalent value.  If you don't want to send me 
        anything, take a kid fishing or go feed the ducks.
        
        I will continue to update ARIEL as the mood hits me and as I
        learn new programming tricks.

        This is the full-blown program, registration doesn't unlock any 
        hidden features.  I don't believe in CrippleWare. 

    Purpose

        Ariel was written with two purposes in mind.  First was to
        provide a basic design program for high frequency (HF) antennas.  
        Second was an attempt by the author to gain some experience 
        with Borland's Turbo Pascal v6.0 <tm> programming language.

        Ariel will only design antennas below 30 MHz <my appologies
        to K4PKV>.  Inputs of "letters" when the program asks for 
        "numbers" will produce crashes.  Holding the <enter> key down 
        will scroll the display off the screen. 
        
        >>>>> Supply valid inputs and you will get valid outputs. <<<<< 
        
        If you find a bug in the program, please contact me providing 
        as much information as possible.  However, if you feed it garbage 
        and it throws up on your feet, don't come crying to me.  
        Enough said.

        Some basic knowledge of antenna theory, general math and wire
        antenna construction techniques is recommended.  Most of the 
        antenna designs in this version have been constructed, analyzed 
        and tested by the author.  On-air testing was done on either 21 
        or 28 MHz.  All analysis was done using NOSC's MININEC v3.0,
        K6STI's MN v1.65 / v2.05 and W7EL's ELNEC v2.21.  These programs
        allow modeling of antenna arrays including different types of
        terrain and ground conductivity as well as supporting structures.

        The primary purpose of this program is to provide a dimensional
        starting point for the construction of various HF antennas.  It
        is recommended that the more complex arrays be modeled by one of
        the above programs and fine tuned to your individual location.

        No provisions are made for hard copy print outs.  You will have
        to use the "print screen" function on your computer if you want
        a paper copy to work from.  It may not print the IBM graphic
        characters used for the antennas but will give you a working
        copy of the dimensions and associated text information.  

        The print screen function has produced "actual" copies on the
        following printers when properly configured for extended 
        graphics characters:

                HP Deskjet
                HP Laserjet
                Epson LQ series

        No plans are made to add hard copy at this time.

        As a bonus <and because I ran out of antennas I could draw with
        standard ASCII graphics> I have included some basic RF related
        calculation utilities.  These include finding the impedance of
        a quarter-wave matching section, solving LCF calculations, solar
        flux conversions and open-wire transmission line dimensions.
