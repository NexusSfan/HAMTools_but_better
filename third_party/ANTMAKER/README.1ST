RELEASED TO PUBLIC DOMAIN FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE... FEB. 1995

The reason I created Antenna Maker was that I got tired of breaking out
a calculator every time I wanted to build an antenna.  It started with
the Inverted Vee program, then (since I like Quads so much) I figured I'd
write a program that would help me build Quads and finally I decided to
expand on the Inverted Vee program so I could add Traps and cover more
than one band.  I've also included some other Public Domain programs that
I think are pretty good.  Hopefully, you'll get some good use out of all
this stuff...
