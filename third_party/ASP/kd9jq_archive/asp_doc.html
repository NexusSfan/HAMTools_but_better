INTRODUCTION

</center>


<font size="3">
<p>
This program designs single stage common emitter or common source transistor
amplifiers used for narrow band weak signal service.  Many combinations of
design are easily obtained by use of different Automatic or Interactive Design
Routines.  The main goal of this program is to provide functional amplifiers
for Radio Communications.<br>
<p>
For the Contest minded person, a Utility program has been provided to "zero"
in on that optimum operating condition for maximum gain and minimum noise figure
of a particular device.  The designer is reminded that although this design may
be possible with resistive 50 ohm loads, it may not work in the real world.<br>
<p>
Although originally designed for FET, GaAsFET's, IGFET devices, the program
will work with Bipolars.  This program currently does not handle Large Signal
devices.  Some small signal devices with low input/output impedances may look
like Large Signal devices to the optimization routines N1 - N6 and may cause
some inaccuracies.  The Y4 option can be used as an alternative!<br>
<p>
Results of the program and the actual amplifier can vary if proper layout
techniques are not adhered to!  Numerous test amplifiers using the following
transistors have yielded close correlation to the program;<br>
<p>
<center><b>MRF904   3N211   3SK124  3SK205</b></center>
<p>
Through use of this program the you will quickly gain insight as to how to
properly design an Amplifier, even if one is not schooled in Transistor Design.
The documentation will contain some personal insights on how to vary design
parameters to meet different user criterias.<br>
<p>
<center><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></center>
<p>
The Program Window will first pop up.  Press Return F1 for the Device Library,
F2 to make a Data File for a new device and F3 for a schematic representation of
the Matching Circuits for the user to select from.
Enter the device file name (.DAT extension assumed) desired.  A wrong entry or
incorrect path will cause an Error routine to pop up.  You have the option of
trying again or exiting the program.  Make sure the DAT.CFG file has the path
for the .DAT files. The DAT.CFG file must be in the directory where the
.EXE files reside.  Once the selection has been made the Main Menu will pop up.<br>
<p>
<center><b>MAIN MENU Selections</b></center>
<p>
The Main Menu contains selections for Automatic and Interactive routines,
Utilities, Device Configuration, Device Selection, and New File Creation utility.<br>
<p>
<b>Auto Design Routines N1 - N6</b>
<p>
These routines make it easy for the non-technical person to design a
pre-amp and evaluate different transistors real fast.  Pressing the F10 key
while the cursor is on the routine of interest will provide a popup Help
Screen which gives information on that routine.<br>
<p>
QL's are adjusted automatically during these optimizations to insure
positive values of CT.  QL, QU, and Kc are reset to their optimized values
each time a new device is run.  They can be varied during the active
routine with the F3 key.<br>
<p>
When YL (Real) and/or YS (Real) are less than ZL or ZS the matching circuit
automatically defaults to LO-Z Matching.  Losses are included in the
calculations.<br>
<p>
<b>"N1"</b>
This Option Optimizes for High Gain and Low Output VSWR while Optimizing
for Low Noise Figure.<br>
<p>
Minimum Noise and High Gain usually occur at low values of Stern's Stability
Factor K.  This routine will sweep a range of K while checking for minimum
noise figure.<br>
<p>
The designer should be aware that not all devices will provide useable L/C
values for the matching circuits at this value of K.<br>
<p>
<b>"N2"</b>
This Option Optimizes for High Power Out and Low Output VSWR while
Optimizing for Low Noise Figure.<br>
<p>
YL (Real) is adjusted for Highest Output Power (dBm) while YL (Imaginary)
is constantly re-adjusted for Lowest Output VSWR while YS (Real) is
optimized for Lowest Noise Figure while constantly re-adjusting
YS (Imaginary) for Input Reactive Match. The Input is not optimized for
Lowest Input VSWR but for lowest losses since Lowest Noise Figure is what
is desired.<br>
<p>
The Output Power is calculated as Linear Class B Output Power which is less
than or equal to the -1 dB compression point.<br>
<p>
<b>"N3"</b>
This Option Optimizes YL for a specified GT while Optimizing
Output VSWR and Noise Figure.  This option most useful for FET devices.<br>
<p>
The Caculated Gain will be within .1 dB of the User Specified Gain.
YL (Real) is adjusted to the specified gain while YL (Imaginary) is
adjusted for Lowest Output VSWR while Input YS (Real) and YS (Imaginary)
are adjusted for Lowest Noise Figure.<br>
<p>
<b>"N4"</b>
This Option Optimizes Input/Output VSWR at a Designer specified GT.
NF and PO are not optimized.  This option most useful for FET devices
and Interstage Amplifiers where Noise Figure is not critical.<br>
<p>
The Caculated Gain will be within .1 dB of the User Specified Gain.
YL (Real) and YL (Imaginary) are adjusted for Lowest Output VSWR
while Input YS (Real) and YS (Imaginary) are also adjusted for the Lowest
INPUT VSWR.<br>
<p>
<b>"N5"</b>
This Routine allows the user specify a design to a specific Stern's
Stability Factor K.  When first selected, the routine asks the user for a
new K.  K is made larger than the desired during the optimization if it is
found the GS &lt; Gin and/or GL &lt; Gout.  This will allow realistic QL's and
low VSWR's. Output VSWR is optimized in this routine.<br>
<p>
<b>"N6"</b>
This option works just like N5 except Input VSWR is also optimized.
K is made larger than the desired during the optimization if it is
found the GS &lt; Gin and/or GL &lt; Gout.  This will allow realistic QL's and
low VSWR's.  The Input and Output VSWR's are optimized in this routine.<br>
<p>
<b>Interactive Routines Y1 - Y4</b><br>
<p>
Stern's Stability Factor K can not be changed from the default value for
Y1 - Y4 options.  These are user interactive routines and the K is
determined by the user YS and/or YL.<br>
<p>
QL, QU, and Kc can be varied during the active routine by use of the F3 key.
QL's are not adjusted automatically in the Y2 - Y4 routines except QL(input)
of the  Y1 routine.<br>
<p>
When YL (Real) and/or YS (Real) (Y2 - Y4) or just YS(Real) (Y1) are
less than ZL or ZS the matching circuit automatically defaults to LO-Z Matching.<br>
<p>
<b>"Y1"</b>
This Option lets the Designer enter a user specified Tranformer
of known transformation and reactive component.  The Input is optimized
for Best Noise Figure and the Output for VSWR.<br>
<p>
QU (Output) should be adjusted to the measured value after the first run.
QL (Input) is adjusted automatically during the optimization to insure
positive values of CT.  QL (Output) will automatically be calculated during
the run and will be &lt; 1 for most broadband applications.  A Coefficient of
Coupling = 1 for Kc is used for the Transformer.  The program will return to the
 default values when selecting a routine other than Y1.<br>
<p>
<b>"Y2"</b>
This Option accepts the Designers specified YL (Real), calculates
GT while Optimizing for Low Output VSWR and Lowest Noise Figure.<br>
<p>
This routine is useful if the designer just wants to see the effects
of manually varying the Load while maintaining a Low VSWR output and
Lowest Noise Figure for this Load.  The SR routine will do the same by
sweeping a range of Loads at one time but with a given Reactive component
of the Load.<br>
<p>
<b>"Y3"</b>
This Option lets the Designer enter a user specified YL while the
input is optimized for Best Noise Figure.<br>
<p>
This routine is useful if the designer wants to see the effects of
different YL's (Real &amp; Imaginary).  Output is not optimized for Low VSWR.<br>
<p>
<b>"Y4"</b>
This Option lets the Designer enter a user specified YS (Real &amp; Imaginary)
and YL (Real &amp; Imaginary) in order to customize the amplifier.<br>
<p>
The Input is not optimized for Best Noise Figure and the Output is not
optimized for Low VSWR in this selection.<br>
<p>
If N4 Source and Load Admittances are used for Y4, the Gain will be
somewhat higher and the NF reading much lower because in the N4 option
an input Shunt resistor is used which adds to the circuit losses.
The Y4 option assumes YS is a pure source except for Inductor losses.<br>
<p>
<center><b>Utility Routines</b></center>
<p>
<b>"SI" </b>
This Utility will sweep a range of YL(Img) while keeping YL(Real)
fixed. YS(Re &amp; Img), NF, GT, and PO are displayed.  Uses default Q's, Kc's, and K.<br>
<p>
The Status column will indicate OK for Stable and ** for Unsafe conditions.
For Unsafe conditions the ** will indicate different colors for different
degrees of instability defined as;<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>K &gt; 1   Stable                - Cyan
<li>Input Gin is negative only    - Yellow
<li>Output Gout is negative only  - Blue
<li>Gin &amp; Gout are both negative  - Violet
<li>Gin, Gout are negative, K &lt; 1 - Red
</ul>
<p>
<b>"SR"</b>
This Utility will sweep a range of YL(Real) while keeping YL(Img)
fixed. YS(Re &amp; Img), NF, GT, and PO are displayed.  Uses default Q's, Kc's, and K.<br>
<p>

<li>Gin, Gout are negative, K &lt; 1 - Red
</ul>
	
<b>"SZ"</b>
This Utility allows the Designer to change the Real values of the
Source (ZS) and the Load (ZL).  The user has the option of four (4)
different 50 Ohm / 75 Ohm ZS/ZL combinations to work with.  This will
allow use of low loss 75 Ohm cable.<br>
<p>

<b>BroadBand Transformer</b><br>
<p>
    The Turns Ratio "N" is calculated from the given transformed RL and BL<br>
    using a default Kc of 1.  After the first run of Y1, modify Q unloaded<br>
    (F3 Key) to the actual measured value.  Q Loaded is automatically<br>
    calculated.<br>
<p>
<b>Misc. circuits</b><br>
<p>
    The designer need not be limited to the above matching circuits.<br>
    With the YL, YS, YI, and YO provided, other circuits such as<br>
    micro-strip can be utilized.<br>
<p>
    Biasing methods of the transistors are left to the designer.<br>
</ul>
</left>
<center><b>DESIGN AIDS</b></center><br>
<p>
Q's are adjusted in the N1 - N6 and Y1 Routines to automatically provide
real values of CT.  In the Y2 - Y4 Routines, if CT and/or Cc are negative,
then a higher value of QL must be used.<br>
<p>
The Inductance values of LT can also be varied to a desired or measured
value by changing QL if QL is above the minimum value calculated during
the N1 - N6 and Y1 Routines.<br>
<p>
Fo can also be varied to a particular operating frequency if within 10%
of the original data file Fo.<br>
<p>
The turns ratio N has been corrected for the Coefficient of Coupling Kc.<br>
<p>
Excessively high N at the Input could cause device failure even if shunt
back-to-back protection diodes are used if the voltage step up exceeds the
device gate to source breakdown.  Check the Vendor's data sheet for device
maximum ratings.  For Schottky diodes use Vgate =.6V * N +/- Vsource (Volts),
for Switching diodes use Vgate = 1V * N +/- Vsource (Volts).<br>
<p>
In general Capacitive coupling will yield lower VSWRs while the Inductor
Tap will provide lower input losses.<br>
<p>
Use chip capacitors and resistors if possible.  Insure good shielding and
grounding.  Orient Inductors at right angles to each other even with using
shielding.  Use feedthru caps for Supply feeds.  Use low loss BNC or SMA
type connectors.  Use double sided solder plated copper PC Boards with
grounds tied together at numerous spots to provide low ground impedances.<br>
<p>

<b>New File Creation Utility</b><br>
<p>
A window will pop up asking you if you want to enter S-Parameters or
Y-Parameters.  Enter the letter S or Y.<br>
<p>
The program will then prompt you with a series of questions pertaining to
the device you are using.  All questions should be fairly self explanatory, but
if you are not familiar with transistor design at all, then refer to the
following detailed explanations.  At the end of the questions you will be
queried as to whether you want to write these entries to a new data file.<br>
<p>
Making a new data file will allow you to call up the device directly
from the Data Library without re-entering all the parameters again.  Make sure
you specify a file name not already used.  The Data Library will be displayed
at this time in order to show you the current names of the files.  The .DAT
extension is automatically added when you make a new file.<br>

<center><b>SCREEN PLOTTING ROUTINE</b></center>
<p>
The Screen Plotting Routine allows a visual display of Amplifier Gain,
Stability, N.F., and Output VSWR.  The designer can tweak the matching
circuits for optimum performance.  EGA or higher graphics are required
to run this routine.<br>
<p>
Current YS and YL, along with Center Frequency Gain, N,F., and VSWR
are values are also shown. A Stability Color Coded Bar is displayed
at the bottom of the plot as well as the 3dB Bandwidth at the top.<br>
<p>
<center><b>UTILITIES</b></center>
<p>
<b>^F1 GRAPHICS SCREEN DUMP</b><br>
<p>
Pressing "<b>SHIFT + F1</b>" will provide a B&W; Graphics Screen Dump to your
graphics capable printer.   Since the standard DOS GRAPHICS.COM doesn't
allow the user any flexibility a user configurable file <b>DISPLAY.CFG</b> has
been provided to allow customizing of the Screen Dump format to your
particular printer.<br>
<p>
<b>F1  TUNE</b>
<p>
Pressing <b>F1</b> pops up a screen containing the Input and Ouput
Matching Components.  Values can be modified to change performance.
<p>
Changing the Output CT provides the best choice in adjusting the
N.F. without degrading amplifier performance to a large degree.
<p>
Loaded Q's are automatically recalculated when changing inductor values
or Source, Load changes.
<p>
<b>F4  MENU</b>
<p>
Returns to Main Program Menu.  Amplifier Data is not saved.
<p>
<b>F8  DOCUMENTATION</b>
<p>
Returns Modified or Un-Modified Amplifier Design to Main Program.
routine Y4 is used to reconstruct the circuit except for Y1 in which the
Y1 routine is used.<br>
<p>
<b>F10 CFG</b>
<p>
The Plot Utility is normally set to the medium plotting speed and
Mid-Range on frequency sweep.<br>
Plotting speed (or Line density) can be changed and the sweep reset
to a larger or smaller range.<br>
