PCAAD 2.1  Personal Computer Aided Antenna Design

Introduction:
	PCAAD 2.1 is a DOS software package for the analysis and design of antennas,
	including wire antennas, horn antennas, arrays, and microstrip antennas.

Installation of PCAAD:
	Copy the file PCAAD21.ZIP into a directory named C:\PCAAD,
	or similar directory.  Unzip the file, then type PCAAD to begin
	execution.  Use the arrow keys, escape key, and Enter key to
	move through the menus to select a particular antenna category
	and type.  Enter antenna parameters, and PCAAD will compute the
	output data.

Shareware Registration:
	PCAAD 2.1 can be registered for $20.00 from,

User Manual:
	The first 100 registrants will receive a 60 page printed manual
	describing detailed use of PCAAD 2.1, as well as documentation
	concerning the analysis methods used in PCAAD 2.1.	

        Manual Errata:
        The 'SELECT ENTRY' menus shown on pages 18 and 23 of the
        manual (for the linear and planar array routines) are missing 
        the bottom entry, which is 'COMPUTE PATTERN'.  As discussed 
        in the manual, this option is used to compute the pattern of 
        the specified array, and must be used before plotting
        patterns, filing patterns, or computing directivity.
