RASCAL 2.1

  RASCAL is a program for interactive design of reflector antennas.

  System Requirements:
    80286 or higher, with math coprocessor.
    MS-DOS 5.0 or higher.
    Mouse with installed driver.

  The disk contains the files:
    README.TXT 
    RASEXE.EXE
    RASSOR.EXE

  Installation:    
    Copy "RASEXE.EXE" to your hard drive in the directory where 
    you want RASCAL to reside. Type in "RASEXE" and hit return. 
    The RASCAL executable files will self-extract. Type "RASCAL" 
    to run the software. Repeat the above procedure with 
    "RASSOR.EXE" for the source files, if desired.

  Comments:
    1. RASCAL can be run either from RASCAL.BAT or from its four different
       executable files.  When running directly from the executables, the
       older data files will NOT be deleted.
    2. Historical reasons present during RASCAL's development caused a 
       non-correspondence between the menu and executable file numbers.
       We apologize for any possible confusion that this may cause.
