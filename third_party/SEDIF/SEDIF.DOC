Version 2.0 - December 92                        
                                                                          
  




ABSTRACT.

        This is a new packet of software destinated to the design,
analysis and simulation of pasive and active filters. It is mainly
directed to engineering education, but this is not an obstacle to be a
perfect system of aid in the filter design needed in industry. The
main characteristic of this new tool is based on the different proposed
alternatives in the design of passive filters, for classic approximations.

Note: This is not a commercial software, so it has not been fully tested
      and may still have some bugs hidden inside.




LIST OF FILES.

        The original floppy disk must contains these five files ...

              ... INSTALL.EXE : Installation utility.
              ... SEDIF.EXE   : Main executable file.
              ... SEDIF.OVR   : Overlays file.
              ... POL.EXE     : Auxiliar executable file.
              ... SEDIF.DOC   : This file.




INSTALLATION.

        There is an installation utility called INSTALL in the original
disk. After typing INSTALL, chose the source and the destination
directory, and the software will be installed.







HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS.

        The minimum hardware requeriments needed to run SEDIF are:

              - A PC compatible computer with a 80X86 microprocessor.
              - 640 Kbytes of RAM.
              - 600 Kbytes in a hard or floppy disk.
              - VGA monitor card.

        No mathematical coprocessor is required but with it important
improvements in calculation time will be obtained.
