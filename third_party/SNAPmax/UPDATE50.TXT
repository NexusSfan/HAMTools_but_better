          Changes in Versions 500 and 501 of SNAPmax
          ------------------------------------------

          SNAPmax was extensively rewritten for V.500/501. Although
          it has not changed in its essential "look and feel", many
          great features have been added.  If you have used SNAPmax
          previously, it will look a little different in places but
          you will find that it's comfortably similar in use and in
          general appearance, even to much earlier versions.


         **   USING SNAP.INI FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS of SNAPmax    **
         **  ==================================================   **
         ** As SNAPmax is now set up for free non-commercial use  **
         ** it generates a new .INI file for you automatically.   **


         Version 501 adds noise vs. freq. presentation for your site.

         The enhancements in Version 500 were:-
          o A new display shows the performance of any of many modes
            (CW, PSK, RTTY, TOR, SSB, AM, broadcast AM, wideband FM)
            as Good, Median & Poor --- depending on their required
            bandwidth and inherent efficiency.
          o Three remote sites are saved, with transmit antenna data,
            power, name, prefix, latitude and longitude. A fourth
            "site" presents ground wave propagation for your station.
            All site data may be saved independently for future use.
            The data you use for "Band Open" can now be saved too.
          o For digital modes, multipath delay is calculated, and the
            likely onset of significant signal distortion indicated.
          o Long path can be selected and displayed.
          o Noise data for VK1 thru VK8, ZL, JA, ZS, DL, F and many
            other world wide etc. countries is now included.
          o A frequency scan from 2 - 12 MHz can now also be selected
            for better detail on lower bands, for example in NVIS use.
          o An option allows an approximate estimate of "chordal hop"
            signals, but makes no prediction of mode probability.
          o The 'analysis' graphic displays have been improved and now
            show signal-noise ratio and required levels. ["Good" etc.]
          o Day/night condition at the ends and mid-point are shown.
          o FOT is now shown on print-outs as well as on screen.
          o Presentation and operation much simplified and improved.
          o Many technical improvements described in tech. data files.

          Versions in the 400 series were developmental.

          These features were added in Versions 34 and 35:-
          o  You can select your own preferred default start-up mode.
          o  The graphic 'analysis' mode has E,F mode flags, shows
              probable limits of MUF and has much path data.
          o  MUF is from Fricker's equations (from the BBC).
          o  Antipodal focusing is included with optional extent.
          o  Auroral zone loss calculations are provided to Northern
              and Far Southern stations using near-polar routes.
          o  Users can use internally calculated antenna gain, their
              own gain values or zero-gain isotropic antennas.
          o  Users in USA, Canada, Australia, NZ & UK have internal
              noise maps; anywhere else, you can use your own noise
              map data, as well as an approximate internal value.
          o  All QTH records are compatible with earlier versions.
