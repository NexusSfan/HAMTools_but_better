              VHFProp -- An interactive Signal Analysis Program
                 for the 6 Meters through 23 CM Amateur Bands

This program allows the user to estimate received signal strength from a
distant VHF/UHF amateur radio station in the 6 meter to 23 cm bands.  The
estimate is based on distance between stations, transmitted power, antenna gain
of both the transmitting and receiving stations, line losses, antenna heights,
station site heights above average terrain, and other factors.

This is a MSDOS program -- no installation is required.
