The files on this disk are compressed and archived to allow 
all of the programs and antenna files to be shipped on a 
single 720K floppy disk. 

For example: To install these programs and archived utility 
files from drive B to drive C, insert this disk in your 3.5" 
drive and enter:

        	 INSTALL B C         <ENTER>
              (or enter the appropriate drives.)

A sub-directory labeled YAGIMAX will be created on that drive
and all files will be copied or un-archived to it. 
THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO YOUR AUTOEXEC.BAT OR CONFIG.SYS FILES. 

If you are a single 720K floppy drive user, I recommend 
that you find a friend who has a hard drive and install the 
programs. Then copy the programs and files to two 720K disks.
